r"""Fable layer, core (pure functions, standard library only).

What strong runs do that ours does not, turned into things the harness can compute from the recorded frames
(no model call, nothing written by the model):

  * watch the legend / tray / counter every turn and note which action changed it   -> small_far_changes, Ledger.feed
  * keep per-key notes of what each control did, with the state it was pressed in    -> Ledger.key_lines
  * remember what the previous levels taught (the keys' effects, the clearing run)  -> Ledger.digest_lines
  * record the step budget early and warn when little is left                        -> detect_budget, budget_alert

The text goes into the agent's context only in two places: one short line per turn when an indicator patch changed or the
budget runs low, and one pinned LEVEL LOG when a level has taken a long time (see fable_layer_patch.py). Everything is
conservative: a detector that is unsure says nothing.

Frames are 2-D integer grids (rows of ints 0-15). History entries are (action_name, result_dict, grid_after) in order.
